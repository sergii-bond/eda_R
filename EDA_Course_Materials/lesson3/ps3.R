# Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
# Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
# the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
# be different for each histogram.

# If you want a hint, check out the Instructor Notes.

# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about

# You might use a simple histogram, a boxplot split over a categorical variable,
# or a frequency polygon. The choice is yours!

# You can find a link to the Gapminder website in the Instructor Notes.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
#       1. any questions you answered, your observations, and summary statistics
#       2. snippets of code that created the plots
#       3. links to the images of your plots

#The following command may be helpful for some of the Gapminder Data sets, 
#once it's been converted to csv format: 
#read.csv('data.csv', header = T, row.names = 1, check.names = F). 
#You may want to look at additional function arguments in the help file for the read.table() 
#family for additional tools that can help you read in data.

#If you want to exchange the rows and columns of your dataframe, 
#it will also be useful to know the transpose function, t().

# Your task is to investigate the distribution of your friends'
# birth months and days.

# Here some questions you could answer, and we hope you think of others.

# **********************************************************************

# How many people share your birthday? Do you know them?
# (Reserve time with them or save money to buy them a gift!)

# Which month contains the most number of birthdays?

# How many birthdays are in each month?

# Which day of the year has the most number of birthdays?

# Do you have at least 365 friends that have birthdays on everyday
# of the year?

# **********************************************************************

# You will need to do some data munging and additional research to
# complete this task. This task won't be easy, and you may encounter some
# unexpected challenges along the way. We hope you learn a lot from it though.

# You can expect to spend 30 min or more on this task depending if you
# use the provided data or obtain your personal data. We also encourage you
# to use the lubridate package for working with dates. Read over the documentation
# in RStudio and search for examples online if you need help.

# You'll need to export your Facebooks friends' birthdays to a csv file.
# You may need to create a calendar of your Facebook friends’ birthdays
# in a program like Outlook or Gmail and then export the calendar as a
# csv file.

# Once you load the data into R Studio, you can use the strptime() function
# to extract the birth months and birth days. We recommend looking up the
# documentation for the function and finding examples online.

# We've included some links in the Instructor Notes to help get you started.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
